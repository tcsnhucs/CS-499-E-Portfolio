      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is T.J. Comer, and this is my E-Portfolio for my college career in computer science at SNHU. I've been in the CS program at SNHU for almost 2 years. I started attending SNHU in the summer of 2024. Before I attended SNHU, I also attended CUNY Hunter's computer science program for 2 years, marking the beginning of my college education during the fall of 2022, making it almost 4 years since I began my education in computer science.</p>

      <h2>Education Review</h2>
      <p>Throughout this program, I have dramatically increased my skills in computer science. I would say the main three skills I have learned throughout this program are: The fundamentals of object oriented programming and designing from the ground up in object oriented systems, how to ensure a program fits the needs of the user/client that it is being developed for, and the importance of considering long term service / future development from the very start, ensuring that from the very beginning of a project you have high quality code as well as allowing for future scalability.</p>

      <p>This e-Portfolio will showcase my ability to refine what I have worked on in the past, improve it with new features and improve on old features. I want to ensure that all of my enhancements will be user friendly, and be smooth to operate.</p>

      <p>My career plans are to become a software engineer, focusing on designing and development of computer software. These skills I am demonstrating will allow me to showcase my skills for designing software that is user friendly and approachable from the standard user, as well as efficiently and smartly developed software that fulfills its purpose to the best of its ability.</p>

      <p>Since I am specializing in the design and development of computer software, my improvements on these projects will showcase my ability to both design new features and put those designs into practice with smartly developed code. Throughout the courses of the SNHU Computer Science program, there has always been a focus on highlighting the importance of user needs, and I will highlight that focus by ensuring all of my enhancements are implemented with the thought of "how will the user benefit from these changes?" By making sure that this question is always considered, I will be able to show off my ability to design and develop software that a user will want to use.</p>

      <p>My e-Portfolio showcases just some of the strengths, and skills I have learned while at SNHU. Beyond what is showcased in my e-Portfolio, I have also learned skills such as how to work as a member of scrum team, full stack MEAN development, the importance of data encryption and secure protections for products, and how to develop my own AI model.
